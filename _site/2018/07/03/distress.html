<p>Times of Distress</p>

<p>When everything was smooth,</p>

<p>The road of life had no ditches, no speedbreakers,</p>

<p>There came a diversion, I saw,</p>

<p>The single smooth road was divided into two rough roads,</p>

<p>on one side there was thunderstorm and on other side there was scorching sun;</p>

<p>I took the first way, thought that it has to say something,</p>

<p>there were Bolting-Thunders and one fell upon me…</p>

<p>It hurt a lot, somehow came back from the way running, jumping and dying,</p>

<p>Recovered, again the road went smooth, but then the next day same diversion came across me…</p>

<p>This time I opted for the scorching sun, the heat was too strong, as it knew I wasn’t prepared,</p>

<p>that I wasn’t strong enough, came back from that horrible sun,</p>

<p>The next day same thing this time,</p>

<p>As it was meddling with my thoughts,</p>

<p>Suddenly I caught a sight of a person staring at me,</p>

<p>He smiled as if he could read my mind and  said</p>

<p>“The thunder-bolts and the heat of the sun were just difficult problems,</p>

<p>that you have never expected to come across and the paths were the experience you had…”</p>

<p>Then he said “This is life and this is how it goes, full of surprises,</p>

<p>but the experiences surely teaches us one or two things”,</p>

<p>I turned to the paths and when I got the point I turned around but found out that he vanished….</p>
