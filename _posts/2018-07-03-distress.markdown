Times of Distress

When everything was smooth,

The road of life had no ditches, no speedbreakers, 

There came a diversion, I saw, 

The single smooth road was divided into two rough roads, 

on one side there was thunderstorm and on other side there was scorching sun;

I took the first way, thought that it has to say something, 

there were Bolting-Thunders and one fell upon me...

It hurt a lot, somehow came back from the way running, jumping and dying,  

Recovered, again the road went smooth, but then the next day same diversion came across me...

This time I opted for the scorching sun, the heat was too strong, as it knew I wasn't prepared, 

that I wasn't strong enough, came back from that horrible sun, 

The next day same thing this time, 

As it was meddling with my thoughts, 

Suddenly I caught a sight of a person staring at me,

He smiled as if he could read my mind and  said 

"The thunder-bolts and the heat of the sun were just difficult problems, 

that you have never expected to come across and the paths were the experience you had..." 

Then he said "This is life and this is how it goes, full of surprises, 

but the experiences surely teaches us one or two things",

I turned to the paths and when I got the point I turned around but found out that he vanished....
