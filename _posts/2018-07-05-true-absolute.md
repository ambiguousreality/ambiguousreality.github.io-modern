True and Absolute

Happiness is a state of mind,
Not the luxuries which make you blind.
It is only inside that you'll find.
The doorway to the other side.
The mind is a beautiful tool.
Use it and don't be used.
For if you use it; it's not you.
You are the user; 
So you got the right to choose.
Choose positivity,
Forget all about sadness.
Trust me!
Until eternity shall you experience,
True and absolute; Happiness.
