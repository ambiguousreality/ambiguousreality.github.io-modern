True Unraveler

Sometimes,
We feel broken from the inside.
Like we've nowhere left to hide.
The heart completely loses it's shine.
Rhymes,
No longer make sense,
Left fragile with no defence,
Everything becomes just so intense.
Hard times,
Only leave us stronger.
We have within us our worst monster.
Do not be it's puppet any longer.
Stand up for your honor.
It'll soon vanish in complete ponder.
Leaving behind only the true unraveler.
